## Introduction:
This is a basic text editor written in rust.

The text editor has just a few basic functions right now:

- Appending lines to the end of the document
- Quitting the text editor
- Printing the document text

## Installing:
Clone the repo to your local machine.
Make sure the you have rustc and cargo Rusts package manager installed.

### Cargo build:
for building the binary.

### Cargo run
for running the debugging version.

## Using:
Upon opening the editor you'll be presented with an empty prompt.
text or commands can be provided here at the prompt.

Typing in text and pressing enter will append that text to the end of the file.

### Commands:
- :p will print the file to the screen.
- :q will exit the file

Currently the program lacks a way to save to disk.
